# Machine Learning - Revisit and Upskilling

Welcome to my personal **Machine Learning (ML)** learning repository! 🎯

## 🚀 About This Repository
This repository contains my personalized version of an ML course that I am revisiting to strengthen my foundations, brush up on core concepts, and explore new insights. The original content is available on YouTube and GitHub. While following along, I will:
- **Refine** my understanding of essential ML concepts.
- **Polish** my knowledge by revisiting topics I’ve previously learned.
- **Add** detailed notes and explanations.
- **Include** extra examples and exercises.
- **Apply** concepts with practical implementations.

This repository will serve as both a learning log and a resource for others interested in ML.

## 🛠️ Why I'm Doing This
- Stay updated with the latest ML techniques.
- Solidify my understanding of fundamental concepts.
- Gain hands-on experience by making improvements and adding examples.
- Develop a deeper understanding to stay competitive in the field.

## 📚 What's Inside
